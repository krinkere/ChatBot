    <pattern>REASONS FOR ALLOWANCE</pattern>
    <template>
        Reasons for allowance. If the examiner believes that the record of the prosecution as a whole does not make clear his or her reasons for allowing a claim or claims, the examiner may set forth such reasoning. The reasons shall be incorporated into an Office action rejecting other claims of the application or patent under reexamination or be the subject of a separate communication to the applicant or patent owner. The applicant or patent owner may file a statement commenting on the reasons for allowance within such time as may be specified by the examiner. Failure by the examiner to respond to any statement commenting on reasons for allowance does not give rise to any implication.

    <pattern>WOLCOTT</pattern>
    <template>
        MPEP has a heritage dating back to 1920 to what became known as "Wolcott's Manual". "One of the most fruitful endeavors of the [Patent and Trademark Office] Society in the area of education was the publication of the first Manual of Patent Office Procedure. The first Manual was written by two employees of the Office and was published in 1920 by the Society. This Manual, with its eight revisions, often referred to as Wolcott's Manual, was the only procedural manual available until 1949 when the Patent Office assumed the publication of the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure."
        Since 1920 the Manual and predecessor publication known as "Wolcott's Manual" have been the primary guidance for the Patent Examiner as to everything procedural going on at the Patent Office. In fact, the Manual was not a brand new endeavor but, rather, the continuation of the work of Clinton Leroy Wolcott who was the author of the major procedural work of the then Patent Office Society (later restyled as the Patent and Trademark Office Society), a voluntary professional organization comprised of Commerce Department employees.

    <pattern>FIRST TO FILE</pattern>
    <template>
        In a first-to-file system, the right to the grant of a patent for a given invention lies with the first person to file a patent application for protection of that invention, regardless of the date of actual invention.

    <pattern>FIRST TO DISCLOSE</pattern>
    <template>
        The concept of a "grace" period, under which early disclosure does not prevent the discloser from later filing and obtaining a patent, must be distinguished here from the FTI system. Germany and the UK formerly had a concept of grace period. Both FTI and grace period systems afforded the early discloser protection against later filers. The FTI system allowed non-disclosers to overturn established parties, whereas the grace system only protects early disclosers. The US moved to a grace system on 16 March 2013, which has been termed "first-to-disclose" by some writers

    <pattern>FIRST TO INVENT</pattern>
    <template>
        Canada, the Philippines, and the United States had been among the only countries to use first-to-invent systems, but each switched to first-to-file in 1989, 1998, and 2013 respectively.

        Invention in the U.S. is generally defined to comprise two steps: (1) conception of the invention and (2) reduction to practice of the invention. When an inventor conceives of an invention and diligently reduces the invention to practice (by filing a patent application, by practicing the invention, etc.), the inventor's date of invention will be the date of conception. Thus, provided an inventor is diligent in actually reducing an application to practice, he or she will be the first inventor and the inventor entitled to a patent, even if another files a patent application, constructively reducing the invention to practice, before the inventor.

        However, the first applicant to file has the prima facie right to the grant of a patent. Under the first-to-invent system, when two people claim the same invention, the USPTO would conduct an interference proceeding between them to review evidence of conception, reduction to practice and diligence. Interference can be an expensive and time-consuming process.

        Section 140 of the MPEP: Foreign Filing Licenses 
            In the interests of national security, the United States government imposes restrictions on the export of technical information. These restrictions are administered by the Departments of Commerce, State, and/or Energy depending on the subject matter involved. For the filing of patent applications and registrations of industrial designs in foreign countries, the authority for export control has been delegated to the Commissioner for Patents.

            There are two ways in which permission to file an application abroad may be obtained: either a petition for a foreign filing license may be granted (37 CFR 5.12 ) or an applicant may wait 6 months after filing an application in the USPTO (35 U.S.C. 184 ) at which time a license on that subject matter is no longer required as long as no Secrecy Order has been imposed. 37 CFR 5.11(e)(2).

        All U.S. Patent and Trademark Office employees are legally obligated to preserve pending applications for patents in confidence until they are published or patented in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 122  and 37 CFR 1.14. 35 U.S.C. 122  and 18 U.S.C. 2071 impose statutory requirements which cover the handling of patent applications and related documents. Suspension, removal, and even criminal penalties may be imposed for violations of these statutes.

		Any employee having custody of a patent application or related documents will be responsible for maintaining confidentiality and otherwise conforming with the requirements of law. No part of any application or paper related thereto should be reproduced or copied except for official purposes. Application files must not be displayed or handled so as to permit perusal or inspection by any unauthorized member of the public.

        For applications filed on or after September 16, 2012, the applicant, a patent practitioner of record, the assignee or an assignee of an undivided part interest, or an inventor may provide a written authority for access to a pending or abandoned application kept in confidence under 35 U.S.C. 122(a), except as provided in 37 CFR 1.11, 1.14, 41.6, or 42.412. 

		A person acting in a representative capacity under 37 CFR 1.34  may execute a power to inspect an application only if the patent practitioner was named in the application transmittal papers filed under 37 CFR 1.53  or the national stage documents filed under 37 CFR 1.495  and a power of attorney has not been appointed under 37 CFR 1.32.

    Section 115 of the MPEP -  Review of Applications for National Security and Property Rights Issues:
        For those applications in which the Government has a property interest (including applications indicating national security classified subject matter), responsibility for notifying the Commissioner for Patents of the need for a Secrecy Order resides with the agency having that interest. Applications that are national security classified (see 37 CFR 1.9(i) ) may be so indicated by use of authorized national security markings (e.g., "Confidential," "Secret," or "Top Secret"). National security classified documents filed in the USPTO must be either hand-carried to Licensing and Review or mailed to the Office in compliance with 37 CFR 5.1(a)  and Executive Order 13526 of December 29, 2009. However, the Office will accept such applications filed with the USPTO via the Department of Defense Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) and consider them as filed via the USPTO’s electronic filing system for purposes of 37 CFR 1.16(t)  and 37 CFR 1.445(a)(ii). As set forth in 37 CFR 5.1(d), the applicant in a national security classified patent application must obtain a secrecy order from the appropriate defense agency or provide authority to cancel the markings. A list of contacts at the appropriate defense agency can be obtained by contacting Licensing and Review.

    <template>
    Section 201 of the MPEP -  Types of Applications:   

        Patent applications can be directed to three broad types of subject matter: 

        (A) applications for patents as provided for by 35 U.S.C. 101  relating to a "new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter," etc.;
        (B) applications for plant patents as provided for by 35 U.S.C. 161; and
        (C) applications for design patents as provided for by 35 U.S.C. 171.
        The first type of patent application is sometimes referred to as a "utility" patent applications when being contrasted with a plant or design patent application. The specialized procedure which pertains to the examination of applications for design and plant patents are treated in detail in Chapters 1500 and 1600, respectively. <![CDATA[<a target="_new" href="https://rdms-mpep-vip.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/current#/current/d0e4510.html">MPEP 201</a>]]>

    Section 201.04 of the MPEP -  Provisional Application:   
        Effective December 18, 2013, the Patent Law Treaties Implementation Act of 2012 (PLTIA), title II, amended 35 U.S.C. 111(b)  to more closely align the corresponding provisions for nonprovisional applications in 35 U.S.C. 111(a)  and provisional applications in 35 U.S.C. 111(b). The corresponding provision in 37 CFR 1.53(c)  was revised accordingly.
		A provisional application is a regular national filing that starts the Paris Convention priority year. Foreign filings must be made within 12 months of the filing date of the provisional application if applicant wishes to rely on the filing date of the provisional application in the foreign filed application.

    Section 201.06(c) of the MPEP -  37 CFR 1.53(b) and 37 CFR 1.63(d) Divisional-Continuation Procedure:   
        For applications filed on or after September 16, 2012, the filing of a continuing application by all or by fewer than all of the inventors named in a prior application without a newly executed oath or declaration is permitted provided that an oath or declaration in compliance with 37 CFR 1.63, or a substitute statement under 37 CFR 1.64, was executed by or with respect to such inventor and was filed in the earlier-filed application, and a copy of such oath, declaration, or substitute statement showing the signature or an indication thereon that it was executed, is submitted in the continuing application. The inventor’s oath or declaration must state that the inventor (1) is an original inventor of the claimed invention; and (2) authorized the filing of the patent application for the claimed invention. The inventor’s oath or declaration also must contain an acknowledgement that any willful false statement made in such declaration is punishable under section 1001  of U.S. Code title 18 by fine or imprisonment of not more than 5 years, or both.

        Effective July 14, 2003, continued prosecution application (CPA) practice has been eliminated as to utility and plant applications. Applicants who wish to continue examination of the same claimed invention after the prosecution of a utility or plant application is closed should consider filing a request for continued examination (RCE) under 37 CFR 1.114.

Therefore, the identifying data of all prior applications for which benefits are claimed should be reviewed by the examiner to ensure that the data is accurate and provided in an application data sheet for applications filed on or after September 16, 2012, or provided in either the first sentence(s) of the specification or in an application data sheet for applications filed prior to September 16, 2012. See 37 CFR 1.78(a)(3)  and (d)(2)  and MPEP § 211 et seq. For example, the reference to a prior nonprovisional application must include the appropriate relationship (e.g., continuation, divisional, or continuation-in-part) between the nonprovisional applications.

    Section 818.01(d) of the MPEP -  Cross-Noting:   
        When two or more independent and distinct inventions are presented for examination, the examiner may make a restriction requirement if a serious burden exists. In the reply to the restriction requirement, applicant must elect one invention for examination. If applicant wishes to traverse the restriction requirement, the reply must also include a traversal with specific reasons why applicant believes the restriction requirement is in error.

        Regardless of the presence of a linking claim, a proper traverse must include a written statement of the reasons for traverse, distinctly and specifically pointing out the supposed errors upon which the applicant relies for his or her conclusion that the requirement is in error. If restriction is made final following consideration of a traverse, the right to petition is preserved even if all linking claims are canceled. When a final restriction requirement is contingent on the nonallowability of the linking claims, applicant may petition from the requirement under 37 CFR 1.144  without waiting for a final action on the merits of the linking claims or applicant may defer his or her petition until the linking claims have been finally rejected, but not later than the notice of appeal. See 37 CFR 1.144  and MPEP § 818.01(c).

In 37 CFR 3.1, assignment of patent rights is defined as "a transfer by a party of all or part of its right, title and interest in a patent [or] patent application...." An assignment of a patent, or patent application, is the transfer to another of a party’s entire ownership interest or a percentage of that party’s ownership interest in the patent or application. In order for an assignment to take place, the transfer to another must include the entirety of the bundle of rights that is associated with the ownership interest, i.e., all of the bundle of rights that are inherent in the right, title and interest in the patent or patent application.ue).

    <template>
    Section 301 of the MPEP -  Ownership/Assignability of Patents and Applications - LICENSING:   
        As compared to assignment of patent rights, the licensing of a patent transfers a bundle of rights which is less than the entire ownership interest, e.g., rights that may be limited as to time, geographical area, or field of use. A patent license is, in effect, a contractual agreement that the patent owner will not sue the licensee for patent infringement if the licensee makes, uses, offers for sale, sells, or imports the claimed invention, as long as the licensee fulfills its obligations and operates within the bounds delineated by the license agreement.
		An exclusive license may be granted by the patent owner to a licensee. The exclusive license prevents the patent owner (or any other party to whom the patent owner might wish to sell a license) from competing with the exclusive licensee, as to the geographic region, the length of time, and/or the field of use, set forth in the license agreement.

    <pattern>TITLE REPORT</pattern>
    <template>
    Section 320 of the MPEP -  Title Reports:   
        The "title report" is a form which can be used under certain circumstances by the Assignment Division to report to someone within the Office the name of the owner of an application or patent as shown by the Assignment Division records on the date the title report is made. For example, a title report is requested by the Reexamination Preprocessing Staff when a request for reexamination is filed. Title reports may not be ordered by applicants or attorneys. 

        Information as to the title is not normally required by the examiner to examine an application. It is only in limited circumstances when the ownership becomes an issue and an examiner needs a title report. See MPEP § 303. Examiners may obtain a title report using the PALM Intranet (select "General Information," insert the appropriate application number, select "Search," select "Assignments"). The screen resulting from the search may be printed to yield the copy of the title report.

    <template>
    Section 401 of the MPEP -  U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Cannot Aid in Selection of Patent Practitioner:   
        An applicant who is a juristic entity must be represented by a patent practitioner. An applicant for patent, other than a juristic entity (e.g., organizational assignee), may file and prosecute his or her own application, and thus act as his or her own representative (pro se) before the Office. See 37 CFR 1.31. In presenting (whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating) papers to the Office, a pro se applicant is making the certifications under 37 CFR 11.18(b), and may be subject to sanctions under 37 CFR 11.18(c)  for violations of 37 CFR 11.18(b)(2). See 37 CFR 1.4(d)(4). See also MPEP §§ 402.03 and 410.
        If patentable subject matter appears to be disclosed in a pro se application and it is apparent that the applicant is unfamiliar with the proper preparation and prosecution of patent applications, the examiner may suggest to the applicant that it may be desirable to employ a registered patent attorney or agent. It is suggested that form paragraph 4.10 be incorporated in an Office action if the use of an attorney or agent is considered desirable and if patentable subject matter exists in the application

        An applicant may give a power of attorney to one or more patent practitioners or one or more joint inventors. A power of attorney to a joint inventor will be recognized even though the one to whom it is given is not a registered practitioner.
        For a power of attorney to be valid, the attorney or agent appointed must be registered to practice before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in accordance with 37 CFR 11.6. Note that under 37 CFR 11.6(c), certain foreigners who are in good standing before the patent office of the country in which they reside and practice may be registered as a patent agent to practice before the Office for the limited purpose of presenting and prosecuting patent applications of applicants located in such country.

           Small entity status may be established by the submission of a simple written assertion of entitlement to small entity status. The assertion must be signed, clearly identifiable, and convey the concept of entitlement to small entity status. 37 CFR 1.27(c)(1). The written assertion is not required to be presented in any particular form. Written assertions of small entity status or references to small entity fees will be liberally interpreted to represent the required assertion. The written assertion can be made in any paper filed in or with the application and need be no more than a simple sentence or a box checked on an application transmittal letter.

        Section 509.04 of the MPEP - Micro Entity Status: 
            The fees which are reduced by 75% for micro entities include filing fees (nonprovisional and provisional), search fees, examination fees, issue fees, and appeal fees for utility, design, plant, and reissue patent applications. Also included are patent maintenance fees including the maintenance fee grace period surcharges as well as the surcharge for a petition to accept a delayed maintenance fee payment in order to reinstate an expired patent. 
            There are two separate bases for establishing micro entity status referred to as the "gross income basis" under 35 U.S.C. 123(a)  and the "institution of higher education basis" under 35 U.S.C. 123(d).  For new application filings not previously assigned a patent application number, providing the first named inventor and the title of the invention at the top of the certification form(s) in the spaces provided will be sufficient to identify the application. It is strongly recommended that the following document descriptions in EFS-Web be used as appropriate:
                • Certification of Micro Entity (Gross Income Basis)
                • Certification of Micro Entity (Education Basis)

        Section 605.01 of the MPEP - Applicant for Application filed on or after September 16, 2012: 
            37 CFR 1.42  defines who is the applicant for a patent. The word "applicant" when used in title 37 refers to the inventor or all joint inventors, or to the person applying for a patent as provided in 37 CFR 1.43, 1.45, or 1.46. If a person is applying for a patent as provided in 37 CFR 1.46, the word "applicant" refers to the assignee, the person to whom the inventor is under an obligation to assign, or the person who otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest in the matter, who is applying for the patent under 37 CFR 1.46  and not the inventor. If fewer than all joint inventors are applying for the patent as provided in 37 CFR 1.45, the phrase "the applicant" means the joint inventors who are applying for the patent without the omitted inventor(s).

    Section 702 of the MPEP -  Requisites of the Application:   
        Except for design applications, the filing date for nonprovisional applications filed on or after December 18, 2013 is the date on which a specification, with or without claims, is received in the Office. Similarly, provisional applications filed on or after December 18, 2013 may receive a filing date even if the application is filed without drawings. The filing date for a design application, except for a continued prosecution application (CPA) under 37 CFR 1.53(d), is the date on which the specification as required by 35 U.S.C. 112, including at least one claim, and any required drawings are received in the Office. Also, for applications filed on or after December 18, 2013, an application (other than an application for a design patent) is not required to include any drawings to be entitled to a filing date. It should be noted, however, 35 U.S.C. 111(a)(2)  continues to require the application to include a drawing as prescribed by 35 U.S.C. 113, which requires a drawing where necessary for the understanding of the subject matter sought to be patented. Therefore, any drawings necessary for the understanding of the invention should be submitted with the application on filing

    <template>
    Section 704.11 of the MPEP - Requirements for Information:

        The criteria stated in 37 CFR 1.105  for making a requirement for information is that the information be reasonably necessary to the examination or treatment of a matter in an application. The information required would typically be that necessary for finding prior art or for resolving an issue arising from the results of the search for art or from analysis of the application file. A requirement for information necessary for finding prior art is not a substitute for the examiner performing a search of the relevant prior art; the examiner must make a search of the art according to MPEP §§ 704.01 and 904 – 904.03.

        The criteria of reasonable necessity is generally met, e.g., where:
            (A) the examiner’s search and preliminary analysis demonstrates that the claimed subject matter cannot be adequately searched by class or keyword among patents and typical sources of non-patent literature, or
            (B) either the application file or the lack of relevant prior art found in the examiner’s search justifies asking the applicant if he or she has information that would be relevant to the patentability determination.

    <template>
        Section 702.01 of the MPEP - Obviously Informal Cases:
        When an application is taken up for examination and it is then discovered to be impractical to give a complete action on the merits because of an informal or insufficient disclosure, the following procedure may be followed:

            (A) A reasonable search should be made of the invention so far as it can be understood from the disclosure, objects of invention and claims and any apparently pertinent art cited. In the rare case in which the disclosure is so incomprehensible as to preclude a reasonable search, the Office action should clearly inform applicant that no search was made;
            (B) Any form that lists informalities and any additional formal requirements to be made should be included in the first Office action (see MPEP § 707.07(a));
            (C) A requirement should be made that the specification be revised to conform to idiomatic English and United States patent practice;
            (D) The claims should be rejected as failing to define the invention in the manner required by 35 U.S.C. 112  if they are informal. A blanket rejection is usually sufficient.

        The examiner should attempt to point out the points of informality in the specification and claims. The burden is on the applicant to revise the application to render it in proper form for a complete examination.

        A preliminary examination of this application reveals that it includes terminology which is so different from that which is generally accepted in the art to which this invention pertains that a proper search of the prior art cannot be made. 

        Applicant is required to provide a clarification of these matters or correlation with art-accepted terminology so that a proper comparison with the prior art can be made. Applicant should be careful not to introduce any new matter into the disclosure (i.e., matter which is not supported by the disclosure as originally filed).
        A shortened statutory period for reply to this action is set to expire TWO MONTHS from the mailing date of this letter.

        Use form paragraph 7.02 where the application is so incomprehensible that a reasonable search cannot be made.

        Applicant is required to submit an amendment which clarifies the disclosure so that the examiner may make a proper comparison of the invention with the prior art.
        Applicant should be careful not to introduce any new matter into the disclosure (i.e., matter which is not supported by the disclosure as originally filed).

        Where an application, properly assigned to one Technology Center (TC), is found to contain one or more claims, per se, classifiable in one or more other TCs, which claims are not divisible inter se or from the claims which govern classification of the application in the first TC, the application may be referred to the other TC(s) concerned for a report as to the patentability of certain designated claims. This report is known as a Patentability Report (P.R.) and is signed by the primary examiner in the reporting TC.
        Note that the Patentability Report practice is only to be used in extraordinary circumstances. See MPEP § 705.01(e).

    <pattern>REJECTION OF CLAIMS</pattern>
    <template>
        Section 706 of the MPEP - Rejection of Claims:
            After the application has been read and the claimed invention understood, a prior art search for the claimed invention is made. With the results of the prior art search, including any references provided by the applicant, the patent application should be reviewed and analyzed in conjunction with the state of the prior art to determine whether the claims define a useful, novel, nonobvious, and enabled invention that has been clearly described in the specification. The goal of examination is to clearly articulate any rejection early in the prosecution process so that the applicant has the opportunity to provide evidence of patentability and otherwise reply completely at the earliest opportunity. The examiner then reviews all the evidence, including arguments and evidence responsive to any rejection, before issuing the next Office action. Where the examiner determines that information reasonably necessary for the examination should be required from the applicant under 37 CFR 1.105, such a requirement should generally be made either prior to or with the first Office action on the merits and should follow the procedures in MPEP § 704.10 et seq.

    <template>
        Section 706.07 of the MPEP - Final Rejection:
            Before final rejection is in order a clear issue should be developed between the examiner and applicant. To bring the prosecution to as speedy conclusion as possible and at the same time to deal justly by both the applicant and the public, the invention as disclosed and claimed should be thoroughly searched in the first action and the references fully applied; and in reply to this action the applicant should amend with a view to avoiding all the grounds of rejection and objection. Switching from one subject matter to another in the claims presented by applicant in successive amendments, or from one set of references to another by the examiner in rejecting in successive actions claims of substantially the same subject matter, will alike tend to defeat attaining the goal of reaching a clearly defined issue for an early termination, i.e., either an allowance of the application or a final rejection.

        Based upon the earlier effective filing date of the copending application, it would constitute prior art under 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2), if published under 35 U.S.C. 122(b)  or patented under 35 U.S.C. 151. This provisional rejection under 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)  is based upon a presumption of future publication or patenting of the copending application. [4].

        As long as principal ownership rights to either the subject matter or the claimed invention under examination reside in different persons or organizations common ownership does not exist.

        ThAbandonment may be either of the invention or of an application. This discussion is concerned with abandonment of the application for patent.
		An abandoned application, in accordance with 37 CFR 1.135  and 1.138, is one which is removed from the Office docket of pending applications through:
			(A) formal abandonment
			(B) failure of applicant to take appropriate action within a specified time at some stage in the prosecution of the application.
		The procedure available for reviving an application that has become abandoned due to a failure to reply to an Office Action is a petition under 37 CFR 1.137(a)  based on unintentional delay.
		
		37 CFR 1.137  provides for the revival of abandoned applications, or terminated or limited reexamination prosecution on the basis of unintentional delay for the failure:
			(A) to timely reply to an Office requirement in a provisional application;
			(B) to timely prosecute in a nonprovisional application;

    <template>
        Section 713 in the MPEP - Interview:
        An interview should be granted when the nature of the case is such that the interview serves to develop or clarify outstanding issues in an application. 

        All discussions between the applicant/practitioner and the examiner regarding the merits of a pending application will be considered an interview and are to be made of record. This includes any and all records or communications received in connection with the interview, whether the interview was conducted in-person or through a telephone conversation, video conference, electronic mail, or electronic message system. This policy and other interview tips are detailed in the Interview Best Practices document which is available at <![CDATA[<a target="_new" href="www.uspto.gov/patents/law/exam/interview_ best_ practices.pdf">www.uspto.gov/patents/law/exam/interview_ best_ practices.pdf</a>]]>

        Interviews that are solely for the purpose of "sounding out" the examiner, as by a local attorney acting for an out-of-town attorney, should not be permitted when it is apparent that any agreement that would be reached is conditional upon being satisfactory to the principal attorney.
        Normally, one interview after final rejection is permitted in order to place the application in condition for allowance or to resolve issues prior to appeal.

			(D) when and as specifically required by the examiner. 
		Amendments in provisional applications are not normally made. If an amendment is made to a provisional application, however, it must comply with the provisions of 37 CFR 1.121. 
		An amendment must be signed by a person having authority to prosecute the application. An unsigned or improperly signed amendment will not be entered. See MPEP § 714.01(a).
		Actions by applicant, especially those filed near the end of the period for reply, should be reviewed as soon as possible upon becoming available to the examiner to determine whether they are completely responsive to the preceding Office action so as to prevent abandonment of the application

        Section 724 in the MPEP: Trade Secret, Proprietary, and Protective Order Materials [R-08.2012]
        Parties bringing information to the attention of the Office for use in the examination of applications and reexaminations are frequently faced with the prospect of having legitimate trade secret, proprietary, or protective order material disclosed to the public.

        It is incumbent upon patent applicants, therefore, to bring "material" information to the attention of the Office. It matters not whether the "material" information can be classified as a trade secret, or as proprietary material, or whether it is subject to a protective order. The obligation is the same; it must be disclosed if "material to patentability" as defined in 37 CFR 1.56(b). The same duty rests upon a patent owner under 37 CFR 1.555  whose patent is undergoing reexamination.

		Somewhat the same problem faces a protestor under 37 CFR 1.291(a)  who believes that trade secret, proprietary, or protective order material should be considered by the Office during the examination of an application.
		In some circumstances, it may be possible to submit the information in such a manner that legitimate trade secrets, etc., will not be disclosed, e.g., by appropriate deletions of nonmaterial portions of the information. This should be done only where there will be no loss of information material to patentability under 37 CFR 1.56  or 1.555.

        The term "independent" (i.e., unrelated) means that there is no disclosed relationship between the two or more inventions claimed, that is, they are unconnected in design, operation, and effect. For example, a process and an apparatus incapable of being used in practicing the process are independent inventions. See also MPEP § 806.06 and § 808.01.

        It is further noted that the terms "independent" and "distinct" are used in decisions with varying meanings. All decisions should be read carefully to determine the meaning intended.

        A Markush-type claim recites alternatives in a format such as "selected from the group consisting of A, B and C." See Ex parte Markush, 1925 C.D. 126 (Comm’r Pat. 1925). The members of the Markush group (A, B, and C in the example above) ordinarily must belong to a recognized physical or chemical class or to an art-recognized class.However, when the Markush group occurs in a claim reciting a process or a combination (not a single compound), it is sufficient if the members of the group are disclosed in the specification to possess at least one property in common which is mainly responsible for their function in the claimed relationship.

        Inventions in metallurgy, refractories, ceramics, pharmacy, pharmacology and biology are most frequently claimed under the Markush formula but purely mechanical features or process steps may also be claimed by using the Markush style of claiming. See MPEP § 2173.05(h)

        Section 806.05 in the MPEP - Criteria of Distinctness Between Combination and Subcombination:
        To support a requirement for restriction between combination and subcombination inventions, both two-way distinctness and reasons for insisting on restriction are necessary, i.e., there would be a serious search burden if restriction were not required as evidenced by separate classification, status, or field of search. See MPEP § 808.02.
        The inventions are distinct if it can be shown that a combination as claimed:
            (A) does not require the particulars of the subcombination as claimed for patentability (to show novelty and unobviousness), and
            (B) the subcombination can be shown to have utility either by itself or in another materially different combination.
        When these factors cannot be shown, such inventions are not distinct.

WIPO Standard ST.16 codes (kind codes) include a letter, and in many cases a number, used to distinguish the kind of patent document (e.g., publication of an application for a utility patent (patent application publication), utility patent, plant patent application publication, plant patent, or design patent) and the level of publication (e.g., first publication, second publication, or corrected publication). Detailed information on Standard ST.16 and the use of kind codes by patent offices throughout the world is available on the WIPO website at www.wipo.int/scit/en  under the links for WIPO standards and other documentation

        All foreign patents, published applications, and any other published derivative material containing portions or summaries of the contents of published or unpublished patents (e.g., abstracts) which have been disseminated to the public are available to U.S. examiners. See MPEP § 901.06(a), paragraphs I.C. and IV.C. 

        In general, a foreign patent, the contents of its application, or segments of its content should not be cited as a reference until its date of patenting or its public availability date (e.g., publication date) can be confirmed by an examiner’s review of a copy of the document. Examiners should remember that in some countries, there is a delay between the date of the patent grant and the date of publication.

Other countries perform an examination of the merits on the basis of an extensive search of the prior art, as is done in the U.S. The former are referred to as nonexamining or registration countries, although some systems allow for a rejection on matters apparent on the face of the papers, such as matters of form or statutory subject matter.

        Some examining countries consider participation by the public an inherent feature of their examining system. When an application is found to be allowable by the examiner, it is "published" for opposition. Then there is a period, usually 3 or 4 months, within which members of the public can oppose the grant of the patent. In some countries, the opposing party can be any person or company. In other countries, only those parties who are affected by the outcome can participate in the opposition. The opposition is an inter partes proceeding and the opposing party can ordinarily raise any ground on the basis of which a patent would be refused or held invalid, including any applicable referencesmatter.

        Since a separate patent must be obtained in each country in which patent rights are desired there may be a large number of patents issued in different countries for the same invention. This group of patents is referred to as a family of patents.

        All of the countries listed in paragraph V of Section 901.05 are parties to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and provide for the right of priority. If an application is filed in one of these countries, an application for the same invention thereafter filed in another country, within 1 year of the filing of the first application, will be entitled to the benefit of the filing date of the first application on fulfilling various conditions. See MPEP § 213. The patents or published specifications of the countries of later filing are required to specify that priority has been claimed and to give the country, date, and number of the priority application. This data serves the purpose, among others, of enabling any patent based on the priority application to be easily located

        The purpose of INID Codes ("INID" is an acronym for "Internationally agreed Numbers for the Identification of (bibliographic) Data") is to provide a means whereby the various data appearing on the first page of patent and like documents or in patent gazettes can be identified without knowledge of the language used and the laws applied. They are now used by most patent offices and have been applied to U.S. patents since August 4, 1970. Some of the codes are not pertinent to the documents of a particular country and some which are pertinent may, in fact, not be used. INID codes for industrial designs are similar to, but not identical to, those used for patents and like documents. INID codes for industrial designs are provided separately in the remainder of this section.

        INID codes for industrial designs are similar to, but not identical to, those used for patents and like documents. INID codes for industrial designs may be of most interest to design patent examiners.

        Section 901.05(c) in the MPEP - Obtaining Copies:
        Until October 1, 1995, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (Office) received copies of the published specifications of patents and patent applications from nearly all the countries which issue them in printed form. The Office now receives most foreign patents in the form of CD-ROM and other electronic media. The foreign patents so obtained are available to examiners from the USPTO’s automated search tools such as the Examiner’s Automated Search Tool (EAST), the Web-based Examiner's Search Tool (WEST), the Foreign Patent Access System (FPAS), and from the Foreign Patents Service Center in STIC.

        Examiners can request copies of any foreign patent documents by submitting an online request using the Foreign Patent Request Form available through STIC’s NPL website on the USPTO intranet. Examiners may also request copies directly from the Foreign Patents Service Center of STIC. If examiners so choose, they can make copies themselves.

        Examiners may consult the translators in the Translations Service Center of the Scientific and Technical Information Center (STIC) for oral assistance in translating foreign patents or literature that are possible references for an application being examined. Examiners may also request human (written) translations of pertinent portions of references being considered for citation or already cited in applications

        Examiners may request human (written) translations at any point in the examination process, at the discretion of the individual examiner, but are encouraged to use oral assistance, language reference resources, and machine translations where possible in the early phases of examination. See MPEP § 706.02. Examiners can request human (written) translations, or machine translations, by submitting an online request using the Translations Request Form available through STIC’s NPL website on the USPTO intranet.

        The main Scientific and Technical Information Center (STIC) is located at the Remsen Building, Room 1D58, 400 Dulany Street, Alexandria, VA 22314. STIC maintains Electronic Information Centers (EICs) in each Technology Center (TC) whose mission is to assist patent examiners in the patent process by providing fast, accurate, prior art searches, document deliver services, the provision of foreign patent copies, translations of foreign documents, and access to non-patent literature in electronic format and in print.

        Technical literature, foreign patent documents, and reference and online search services available in STIC are all important resources for the patent examiner to utilize. These resources provide material which must be known or searched to determine whether claims of applications are directly anticipated and, therefore, unpatentable under the provisions of 35 U.S.C. 102. STIC handbooks, textbooks, periodicals, reports, and other materials assist examiners in deciding the question of patentable invention in cases in which the primary search indicates that there is some novelty as compared to any single reference in the art

        In using any classification system, it is necessary to analyze the organization of the class or classes to be included in the search.
        The initial analysis should determine which one or ones of the several types of subject matter (manufacture, art, apparatus, or stock material) are contained in the class being considered.

        Section 902.02  of the MPEP - Search Tools and Classification Information:
        All of the utility classes (i.e., classes devoted to technology), and the plant class have definitions. All design classes will eventually have definitions.
        Definitions state the subject matter of the classes and subclasses in much more detail than it is possible to state in the brief class and subclass titles. A study of the definitions is essential to determine the proper classification of subject matter within the U.S. Patent Classification System (USPC).
        All classes and subclasses (class definitions) in the USPC are available online to USPTO personnel from the Classification Home Page under the heading Search Classification Data. The Classification Home Page (http://ptoweb:8081/ ) is accessible from the desktop via the Patent Examiner’s Toolkit. The class definitions are archived in portable document formats (PDFs) to CD-ROM every June and December.
        It should be noted that classification orders frequently affect existing definitions. Personal sets of definitions used by examiners should be periodically revised to reflect these changes. Classification Orders are available online to USPTO personnel from the Classification Home Page under the heading Classification Reports. The Classification Home Page is accessible from the desktop via the Patent Examiner’s Toolkit.

    <pattern>CLASSIFICATION</pattern>
    <template>
        Section 903.04 of the MPEP - Classifying Applications for Publication:
        Patent application publications are given a primary classification (equivalent to an original classification), and may also be given a secondary classification (equivalent to a cross reference). While there may be only one primary classification for a single patent application publication, there may be any number of secondary classifications. The selection of a primary classification of a patent application publication is based on the application’s main inventive concept using the claims as a guide. A primary classification could be any U.S. class/subclass (except cross reference art collections, digests and foreign art collection subclasses). A secondary classification is based on other inventive concepts (mandatory) or valuable disclosure (discretionary), and may be any U.S. class/subclass (including cross reference collections and digests, but excluding foreign art collection subclasses). The classification of a patent application publication is printed on the front page of the publication.

        At least 9 weeks prior to the projected publication date, applications are classified using programs designed to enable entry of certain data required for publication of patent applications. Applications are classified by giving each application at least a primary classification and an international classification. The suggested international classification(s) corresponding to each assigned U.S. classification is provided. In addition, if a figure is to be published, the figure is selected at the time of classification.

        Section 903.07 of the MPEP - Classifying and Cross-Referencing at Allowance:
        An application, properly classified at the start of examination, may be classified differently when it is ready for allowance. The allowed claims should be reviewed in order to determine the subject matter covered thereby. It is the disclosed subject matter covered by the allowed claims that determines the original and any mandatory cross-reference classification of U.S. patents.

        The procedure for determining the classification of an issuing application is as follows: every claim, whether independent or dependent, must be considered separately for classification. A separate mandatory classification is required for each claim which is classifiable in a different class or subclass; some claims, particularly in chemical areas, may require plural classifications. After all mandatory classifications have been determined, the classification to be designated as the original (OR) is determined.

        II.   TRANSFERS BETWEEN DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY CENTERS
            Where a supervisory patent examiner (SPE) believes an application, either new or amended, does not belong in his or her art unit, he or she may request transfer of the application from his or her art unit (the "originating" art unit) to another art unit of a different TC (the "receiving" art unit).
            The decision as to the classification resolution and assignment of an application is made by agreement between the SPEs involved in the transfer. If no agreement can be reached between the SPEs, the application may be forwarded to the classification dispute TC representative panel of the TC where the application was originally assigned for a final decision. The classification dispute TC representative panel consists of designated representatives from each TCupervisory patent examiner is given the responsibility of assigning applications, time so spent may, at the TC Director’s discretion, be charged to "Assisting SPE."

        When the SPE or primary examiner of the originating art unit determines that a transfer is appropriate, he or she must complete the Application Transfer Request form in Patent File Wrapper (PFW) and provide a full explanation of the reasons for classification in the receiving art unit. At least one of the following should be included in the form in the space provided:
            (A) Identification of the controlling claim;
            (B) Identification of any existing informal transfer agreement; or
            (C) Other reasons – with full explanation.
        If the SPE or examiner of the originating art unit believes an application has been improperly assigned to their art unit, but is unable to determine an appropriate place to send the application, a "gatekeeper" or search assistant should be consulted. A listing of examiners who function in this role may be found at http://ptoweb/patents/tsa/. It is noted that "gatekeepers" or search assistants exist in all of the TCs except the TC that examines design applications (TC 2900).on was originally assigned for a final decision.

        Section 904 of the MPEP - How to Search:
        The examiner, after having obtained a thorough understanding of the invention disclosed and claimed in the nonprovisional application, then searches the prior art as disclosed in patents and other published documents, i.e., nonpatent literature (NPL). Any document used in the rejection of a claim is called a reference. An inventor name search should be made to identify other applications and/or patents which may be applicable as references for double patenting rejections. See MPEP § 804

        Following the first Office action, the examiner need not ordinarily make a second search of the prior art, unless necessitated by amendments to the claims by the applicant in a reply to the first Office action, except to check to determine whether any reference which would appear to be substantially more pertinent than the prior art cited in the first Office action has become available subsequent to the initial prior art search.

        In subsequent actions, where the search is brought up-to-date and/or where a further search is made, the examiner must indicate on the IFW search notes form that the search has been updated and/or identify the additional field(s) of search. See MPEP § 719.05. Any search updates should include all of the relevant or pertinent databases and the search queries and classifications employed in the original search.

        Section 904.02(c) of the MPEP - Internet Searching:
        The Internet is an Office-approved search tool that may be considered when planning and conducting a search for an application. The Internet provides the Office the opportunity to enhance operations by enabling patent examiners to efficiently locate and retrieve additional sources of information relating to a patent application. 

        The Internet is generally a public forum and most communications made over the Internet are neither confidential nor secure. All use of the Internet by examiners must be conducted in a manner that ensures compliance with confidentiality requirements in the statutes, including 35 U.S.C. § 122, and regulations. Additionally, any Internet searching that is conducted is to be limited to searching for the information necessary for examination of the application or proceeding, such as the state of the art or the presence or absence of technical features in the prior art.

        Section 905 of the MPEP - How to Cooperative Patent Classification:
        Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) is a bilateral classification system jointly developed by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the European Patent Office (EPO). CPC is jointly managed and maintained by both offices and is available for public search for classification.

        The CPC classification system arranges subject matter into hierarchical arrays.
            (A) The highest array or level is the Section.
            (B) Each section is subdivided into Classes.
            (C) Each class is subdivided into one or more subclasses.
            (D) Each subclass is broken down into Groups (main groups and subgroups).

        Section 907 of the MPEP - Locarno Classification Designations
        U.S. design patents prepared for issue after June 30, 1996 and international design applications include a Locarno International Classification designation as part of the bibliographic data. The purpose of the international design classification designation is to enhance accessibility of design patents in foreign design search files as well as commercial databases.

        A Locarno International Classification designation consists of two pairs of numbers separated by a hyphen. The first pair of numbers designates a design class; the second pair of numbers indicates a particular subclass within the design class. The Locarno Classification manual, available from WIPO, delineates the individual classes and subclasses and includes: (1) a general list of classes of industrial designs divided into broad subclasses; and (2) an alphabetical list of specific industrial designs with an indication of the classes and subclasses into which they should be classified.

A SIR is a "constructive reduction to practice" under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)  and "prior art" under all applicable sections of 35 U.S.C. 102  including 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)  and pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e). SIRs are classified, cross-referenced, and placed in the search files, disseminated to foreign patent offices, stored in U.S. Patent and Trademark Office computer data bases, made available in commercial data bases, and announced in the Official Gazette.
        Only requests for a statutory invention registration filed prior to March 16, 2013 are timely.

        Section 1125 of the MPEP - Express Abandonment to Avoid Publication:
        Any applicant seeking to abandon the application for the purpose of avoiding publication must take appropriate action well prior to the projected publication date. If the application is not recognized as abandoned at least four weeks prior to the projected publication date, the Office will not be able to avoid publication of the application. This does not imply that a request to expressly abandon an application to avoid publication filed prior to this four-week time frame will ensure that the Office will be able to remove an application from publication. The Office simply cannot ensure that it can remove an application from publication or avoid publication of application information any time after the publication process for the application is initiated (about 4 months prior to the projected publication date).

        Section 1126 of the MPEP - Express Abandonment to Avoid Publication:
        Applicant is required to pay the publication fee to avoid abandonment of the application even if the application has not yet been published at the time when the publication fee is due. The Office will continue with the pre-grant publication process until a patent actually issues. This is because there are many instances in which the Office mails a notice of allowance in an application but the application does not issue as a patent in regular course. Therefore, the Office will not discontinue the pre-grant publication process until a patent has actually issued.
        If an application becomes abandoned without being allowed, no publication fee is required.

        The line of demarcation between appealable matters for the Board and petitionable matters for the Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (Director) should be carefully observed. The Board will not ordinarily hear a question that should be decided by the Director on petition, and the Director will not ordinarily entertain a petition where the question presented is a matter appealable to the Board. However, petitionable matters will rarely be present in a case by the time it is before the Board for a decision.

        After an appeal brief under 37 CFR 41.37  has been filed and the examiner has considered the issues on appeal, the examiner may:
            (A) reopen prosecution to enter a new ground of rejection with approval from the supervisory patent examiner (see MPEP § 1207.04);
            (B) allow the application if the examiner determines that the rejections have been overcome and no new ground of rejection is appropriate; or
            (C) maintain the appeal by conducting an appeal conference (MPEP § 1207.01) and drafting an examiner’s answer (MPEP § 1207.02).
        See MPEP Section 1207.02 (Contents of Examiner’s Answer) for more information.

In such an instance where a new ground of rejection is necessary, the examiner should either reopen prosecution or set forth the new ground of rejection in the answer. The examiner must obtain supervisory approval in order to reopen prosecution after an appeal.sary.

        Section 1207.03(b) of the MPEP - Petition to Designate a New Ground of Rejection and to Reopen Prosecution:
        The examiner may, with approval from the supervisory patent examiner, reopen prosecution to enter a new ground of rejection in response to appellant’s brief.
        In deciding whether to reopen prosecution or to add a new ground of rejection to an examiner's answer where proper under MPEP § 1207.03 et seq., examiners and their supervisors should consider the degree to which the rejection previously of record is being changed, any previous reopenings after appeal brief, and the overall pendency of the application. The Office action containing a new ground of rejection may be made final if the new ground of rejection was (A) necessitated by amendment, or (B) based on information presented in an information disclosure statement under 37 CFR 1.97(c)  where no statement under 37 CFR 1.97(e)  was filed. See MPEP § 706.07(a) for more detail.

Normally, appellant is not required to file a reply brief to respond to an examiner’s answer, and if appellant does not file a reply brief within the two month period of time, the application will be forwarded to the Board for decision on the appeal.

It has been the policy of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to defer issuance of a patent, upon request, for a period of up to 1 month only, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances or requirement of the regulations (e.g., 37 CFR 1.177 ) which would dictate a longer period. Situations like negotiation of licenses, time for filing in foreign countries, collection of data for filing a continuation-in-part application, or a desire for simultaneous issuance of related applications are not considered to amount to extraordinary circumstances.

    <pattern>CANCELED CLAIMS</pattern>
    <template>
    "Canceled claims," in the context of recapture case law, are claims canceled from the original application to obtain the patent for which reissue is now being sought. The claims
        (A) can simply be canceled and not replaced by others, or
        (B) can be canceled and replaced by other claims which are more specific than the canceled claims in at least one aspect (to thereby define over the art of record). The "replacement claims" can be new claims which are narrower than the canceled claims, or can be the same claims amended to be narrower than the canceled version of the claims.

    Section 1412.02 of the MPEPE - Recapture of Canceled Subject Matter:
    A reissue will not be granted to "recapture" claimed subject matter which was surrendered in an application to obtain the original patent. We apply the recapture rule as a three-step process:
        (1) first, we determine whether, and in what respect, the reissue claims are broader in scope than the original patent claims;
        (2) next, we determine whether the broader aspects of the reissue claims relate to subject matter surrendered in the original prosecution; and
        (3) finally, we determine whether the reissue claims were materially narrowed in other respects, so that the claims may not have been enlarged, and hence avoid the recapture

Even in rare cases where, because of an amendment to the claims, the prior art available under 35 U.S.C. 102 and 103 during examination of the reissue application differs from that applied to the original application (see discussion in MPEP § 1440), the overall examination of the reissue application is conducted in the same manner as was the parent.

A patentee may thus seek to provoke an interference with a patent or pending application by filing a reissue application, if the reissue application includes an appropriate reissue error as required by 35 U.S.C. 251. Reissue error must be based upon applicant error; a reissue cannot be based solely on the error of the Office for failing to declare an interference or to suggest copying claims for the purpose of establishing an interference

        Mistakes incurred through the fault of the Office may be the subject of Certificates of Correction under 37 CFR 1.322. The Office, however, has discretion under 35 U.S.C. 254  to decline to issue a Certificate of Correction even though an Office mistake exists. In an effort to reduce the overall time required in processing and granting Certificate of Correction requests, the Office will expedite processing and granting of patentee requests where such requests are accompanied by evidence to show that the error is attributable solely to the Office
    Seciton 1481 of the MPEP - Certificates of Correction - Applicant’s Mistake 
        37 CFR 1.323  relates to the issuance of Certificates of Correction for the correction of errors which were not the fault of the Office. Mistakes in a patent which are not correctable by Certificate of Correction may be correctable via filing a reissue application. Under no circumstances can a Certificate of Correction be employed to correct an applicant’s mistake by adding or correcting a priority claim under 35 U.S.C. 119(e)  for an application filed on or after November 29, 2000.

        In a design patent application, the subject matter which is claimed is the design embodied in or applied to an article of manufacture (or portion thereof) and not the article itself. Since a design is manifested in appearance, the subject matter of a design patent application may relate to the configuration or shape of an article, to the surface ornamentation applied to an article, or to the combination of configuration and surface ornamentation.
        In general terms, a "utility patent" protects the way an article is used and works (35 U.S.C. 101 ), while a "design patent" protects the way an article looks (35 U.S.C. 171 ).

The inventive novelty or unobviousness resides in the ornamental shape or configuration of the article in which the design is embodied or the surface ornamentation which is applied to or embodied in the design.
        Novelty and nonobviousness of a design claim must generally be determined by a search in the pertinent design classes. It is also mandatory that the search be extended to the mechanical classes encompassing inventions of the same general type. Catalogs and trade journals as well as available foreign patent databases are also to be consulted.

         It is clear that the ornamentality of the article must be the result of a conscious act by the inventor, as 35 U.S.C. 171  requires that a patent for a design be given only to "whoever invents any new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture." Therefore, for a design to be ornamental within the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 171, it must be "created for the purpose of ornamenting.
         A determination of ornamentality is not a quantitative analysis based on the size of the ornamental feature or features but rather a determination based on their ornamental contribution to the design as a whole.

         37 CFR 1.155  establishes an expedited procedure for design applications. This expedited procedure is available to design applicants who first conduct a preliminary examination search and file a request for expedited treatment accompanied by the fee specified in 37 CFR 1.17(k). This expedited treatment is intended to fulfill a particular need by affording rapid design patent protection that may be especially important where marketplace conditions are such that new designs on articles are typically in vogue for limited periods of time.

    Section 1512 of the MPEP - Relationship Between Design Patent, Copyright, and Trademark:
         There is an area of overlap between copyright and design patent statutes where the author/inventor can secure both a copyright and a design patent. Thus an ornamental design may be copyrighted as a work of art and may also be subject matter of a design patent. The author/inventor may not be required to elect between securing a copyright or a design patent. In Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201, 100 USPQ 325 (1954), the Supreme Court noted the election of protection doctrine but did not express any view on it since a design patent had been secured in the case and the issue was not before the Court.

Such plants covered by the term "tuber propagated" are the Irish potato and the Jerusalem artichoke. This exception is made because this group alone, among asexually reproduced plants, is propagated by the same part of the plant that is sold as food.

        A second/subsequent but FAOM usually occurs when the first action is a restriction/election action and the second action is an action on the merits. The PALM system will automatically determine if it is a FAOM. If the second action is a FAOM, the action will be listed and credited on the Biweekly Examiner Time and Activity Report as a Second/Subsequent FAOM.examiner docket, attorney, inventor, status, and prosecution history data as well as the location of each paper application can be retrieved and updated online with PALM

In public PAIR, information is available relating to issued patents, published patent applications, and applications to which a patented or published application claims domestic priority. In private PAIR, an applicant (or his or her registered patent attorney or registered patent agent) can securely track the progress of his or her application(s) through the USPTO. Private PAIR makes available information relating to unpublished patent applications, but the applicant must associate a Customer Number with the application to obtain access.

    <template>
    Section 1730 of the MPEP - Information Sources, 1. USPTO Databases:
        The Image File Wrapper (IFW) system uses image technology to replace the paper processing of patent applications in the Office. Paper components of these application files (including the specification, oath or declaration, drawings, information disclosure statements, amendments, Office actions, and file jacket notations) have been scanned to create electronic image files. For patent applications in the IFW system, the IFW file is the Official file and no access is granted to the original paper document sheets used to create the IFW file. All processing and examination is conducted using the electronic images instead of the paper source documents. Questions about IFW images viewed in PAIR should be directed to the Patent EBC.

    Section 1801 of the MPEP - Basic Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) Principles:
        The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) enables the U.S. applicant to file one application, "an international application," in a standardized format in English in the U.S. Receiving Office (the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office), and have that application acknowledged as a regular national or regional filing in as many Contracting States to the PCT as the applicant "designates," that is, names, as countries or regions in which patent protection is desired. The PCT offers an alternative route to filing patent applications directly in the patent offices of those countries which are Contracting States of the PCT. It does not preclude taking advantage of the priority rights and other advantages provided under the Paris Convention and the WTO administered Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS Agreement). The PCT provides an additional and optional foreign filing route to patent applicants.

    Section 1900 of the MPEP - Protest:
       A protest may be filed by a member of the public against a pending application, and it will be matched with the application file if it adequately identifies the patent application. Any information which, in the protestor’s opinion, would make the grant of a patent improper can be relied on in a protest under 37 CFR 1.291. While prior art documents, such as patents and publications, are most often the types of information relied on in protests, 37 CFR 1.291  is not limited to prior art documents. Protests may be based on any facts or information adverse to patentability. The content and substance of the protest are more important than whether prior art documents, or some other form of evidence adverse to patentability, are being relied on. The degree of participation allowed a protestor is solely within the discretion of the Director of the USPTO.

The Office does not serve copies of Office actions or other documents mailed by the Office on protestors, and does not require applicants to serve copies of papers filed with the Office on protestors. Furthermore, a protestor is not permitted to participate in interviews, appeal a decision by the examiner adverse to the protestor to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, or participate in an appeal by applicant.

    Section 2000 of the MPEP - Duty of Disclosure:
       A patent by its very nature is affected with a public interest. The public interest is best served, and the most effective patent examination occurs when, at the time an application is being examined, the Office is aware of and evaluates the teachings of all information material to patentability. Each individual associated with the filing and prosecution of a patent application has a duty of candor and good faith in dealing with the Office, which includes a duty to disclose to the Office all information known to that individual to be material to patentability as defined in this section. The duty to disclose information exists with respect to each pending claim until the claim is cancelled or withdrawn from consideration, or the application becomes abandoned.

    Section 2001.05 of the MPEP - Materiality Under 37 CFR 1.56(b):
       Under the rule, information is not material unless  (1) It establishes, by itself or in combination with other information, a prima facie case of unpatentability of a claim; or (2) It refutes, or is inconsistent with, a position the applicant takes in:(i) Opposing an argument of unpatentability relied on by the Office, or (ii) Asserting an argument of patentability.
       If information is not material, there is no duty to disclose the information to the Office. Thus, it is theoretically possible for applicants to draft claims and a specification to avoid a prima facie case of obviousness over a reference and then to be able to withhold the reference from the examiner.

       A finding of "fraud," "inequitable conduct," or violation of duty of disclosure with respect to any claim in an application or patent, renders all the claims thereof unpatentable or invalid.

       If the application is a reissue application, the action by the examiner may extend to a determination as to whether at least one "error" required by 35 U.S.C. 251  has been alleged, i.e., identified. Further, the examiner should determine whether applicant has averred in the reissue oath or declaration that all "errors" arose "without any deceptive intention." However, the examiner should not normally comment or question as to whether the averred statement as to lack of deceptive intention appears correct or true. See MPEP § 1414.

       B.   Review the Detailed Disclosure and Specific Embodiments of the Invention To Understand What the Applicant Has Invented
       C.   Review the Claims: The claims define the property rights provided by a patent, and thus require careful scrutiny. The goal of claim analysis is to identify the boundaries of the protection sought by the applicant and to understand how the claims relate to and define what the applicant has indicated is the invention.

It is clear from Chakrabarty and subsequent judicial decisions that the question of whether or not an invention embraces living matter is irrelevant to the issue of patentability. Note, however, that Congress has excluded claims directed to or encompassing a human organism from patentability. More infomation in this section includes:

    <pattern>UTILITY</pattern>
    <template>
    Section 2107 of the MPEP - Guidelines for Examination of Applications for Compliance with the Utility Requirement:
      The Office must examine each application to ensure compliance with the "useful invention" or utility requirement of 35 U.S.C. 101. Where an applicant has set forth a specific and substantial utility, courts have been reluctant to uphold a rejection under 35 U.S.C. 101  solely on the basis that the applicant’s opinion as to the nature of the (A) specific and (B) substantial utility was inaccurate.

      A "specific utility" is specific to the subject matter claimed and can "provide a well-defined and particular benefit to the public." [A]n application must show that an invention is useful to the public as disclosed in its current form, not that it may prove useful at some future date after further research. Simply put, to satisfy the ‘substantial’ utility requirement, an asserted use must show that the claimed invention has a significant and presently available benefit to the public. No Statement of Utility for the Claimed Invention in the Specification Does Not Per Se Negate Utility

		It is intended that the examiner’s first ex parte action on the merits be the primary action to establish the issues which exist between the examiner and the patent owner insofar as the patent is concerned. At the time the first action is issued in reexaminations ordered under 35 U.S.C. 304, the patent owner has already been permitted to file a statement and an amendment pursuant to 37 CFR 1.530; and the reexamination requester, if the requester is not the patent owner, has been permitted to reply thereto pursuant to 37 CFR 1.535. In any case, thus, at this point, the issues should be sufficiently focused to enable the examiner to make a definitive first ex parte action on the merits which should clearly establish the issues which exist between the examiner and the patent owner insofar as the patent is concerned

To bring the prosecution to a speedy conclusion and at the same time deal justly with the patent owner and the public, the examiner will twice provide the patent owner with such information and references as may be useful in defining the position of the Office as to unpatentability before the action is made final. 

		In making the final rejection, all outstanding grounds of rejection of record should be carefully reviewed and any grounds or rejection relied on should be reiterated. The grounds of rejection must (in the final rejection) be clearly developed to such an extent that the patent owner may readily judge the advisability of an appeal.

    Section 2302 of the MPEP - Consult an Interference Practice Specialist:
		Every Technology Center (TC) has at least one Interference Practice Specialist (IPS), who must be consulted when suggesting an interference to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (Board).

		Less than one percent of all applications become involved in an interference. Consequently, examiners are not expected to become experts in interference practices. Instead, examiners are expected to be proficient in identifying potential interference and to consult with an IPS in their TC on interference matters. The IPS, in turn, is knowledgeable about when and how to suggest interferences, how to handle inquiries to and from the Board before and during interferences, and how to handle applications after interferences are completed.

    Section 2302 of the MPEP - Consult an Interference Practice Specialist:
		Ownership of an invention made pursuant to a U.S. government contract may be vested in the contracting government agency. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (Board) determines two such ownership contests using interference procedures: for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), 42 U.S.C. 2457 (inventions having significant utility in aeronautical or space activity), and for the Department of Energy (DoE), 42 U.S.C. 2182 (inventions relating to special nuclear material or atomic energy).
		An applicant with an application covered by these Acts must file a statement regarding the making or conception of the invention and any relation to a contract with NASA or DoE. See MPEP § 150 and § 151. The examiner should work in coordination with Licensing and Review and one of the Technology Centers Interference Practice Specialists in suggesting these cases to the Board. Although these cases are not interferences, the interference practices in this chapter generally apply to NASA and DoE ownership contests as well.

    Section 2402 of the MPEP - The Deposit Rules:
		Courts have recognized the necessity and desirability of permitting an applicant for a patent to supplement the written disclosure in an application with a deposit of biological material which is essential to meet some requirement of the statute with respect to the claimed invention.

		To facilitate the recognition of deposited biological material in patent applications throughout the world, the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure was established in 1977, and became operational in 1981. The Treaty requires signatory countries, like the United States, to recognize a deposit with any depository which has been approved by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). 

		The deposit rules (37 CFR 1.801  - 1.809 ) set forth examining procedures and conditions of deposit which must be satisfied in the event a deposit is required. The rules do not address the substantive issue of whether See PCT Rule 13bis  and MPEP § 1823.01 for the requirements under the PCT for a reference to a deposited biological material in an international application.a deposit is required under any particular set of facts. See PCT Rule 13bis  and MPEP § 1823.01 for the requirements under the PCT for a reference to a deposited biological material in an international application.

The term "replacement" is directed to those situations where one deposit is being substituted for another. An applicant may have greater latitude in replacing a deposit during the pendency of an application than after the patent is granted. Replacement will typically take place where the earlier deposit is no longer viable.

		It is generally acceptable to present a single, primary sequence in the specification and sequence listing by enumeration of its residues in accordance with the sequence rules ("primary sequence") and to discuss and/or claim variants of that primary sequence without presenting each variant as a separate sequence in the sequence listing. However, the primary sequence should be annotated in the sequence listing to reflect such variants. The Office's database will only contain the unmodified sequence. It is strongly recommended that any sequences appearing in the claims, or sequences that are considered essential to understanding the invention, be included in the sequence listing as a separate sequence.

		(2) GRACE PERIOD; SURCHARGE. — Unless payment of the applicable maintenance fee under paragraph (1) is received in the Office on or before the date the fee is due or within a grace period of 6 months thereafter, the patent shall expire as of the end of such grace period. The Director may require the payment of a surcharge as a condition of accepting within such 6-month grace period the payment of an applicable maintenance fee.
		(3) NO MAINTENANCE FEE FOR DESIGN OR PLANT PATENT. — No fee may be established for maintaining a design or plant patent in force.

		In order to establish small entity status for the purpose of paying a maintenance fee, a written assertion of entitlement to small entity status must be filed prior to or with the maintenance fee paid as a small entity. 37 CFR 1.27(c)(2)  specifies who can sign and file the written assertion of small entity status. A written assertion of small entity status is only required to be filed once and will remain effective until changed. See MPEP §§ 509.02 and 509.03 regarding the requirements for qualifying as a small entity and the requirements for making an assertion of small entity status.

		Since patentees are expected to maintain their own record and docketing systems and since it is expected that most patentees will pay their maintenance fees during the window period to avoid payment of a surcharge, the Office will not send any reminder notices to the patentee until after the grace period has begun. This will reduce and simplify the mailing of notices but still give patentees an opportunity to pay their maintenance fee with surcharge during the grace period before expiration of their patents. The Office will mail any Maintenance Fee Reminder to the fee address as set forth in 37 CFR 1.363. See MPEP § 2540.

    Section 2710 of the MPEP -  Term Extensions or Adjustments for Delays Within the USPTO Under 35 U.S.C. 154:
		Utility and plant patents issuing on applications filed on or after June 8, 1995, but before May 29, 2000, are eligible for the patent term extension provisions of former 35 U.S.C. 154(b)  and 37 CFR 1.701. See MPEP § 2720. Utility and plant patents issuing on applications filed on or after May 29, 2000 are eligible for the patent term adjustment provisions of 35 U.S.C. 154(b) (effective May 29, 2000 and amended thereafter) and 37 CFR 1.702  -1.705. See MPEP § 2730. See Thomas D. Sykes v. Jon W. Dudas, 573 F.Supp2d 191, 89 USPQ2d 1423 (D.D.C. 2008).

		Since the term of a design patent is not affected by the length of time prosecution takes place, there are no patent term adjustment provisions for design patents. The term "design patents" includes patents issued from design applications filed under 35 U.S.C. 111  and international design applications filed under 35 U.S.C. 385.

When a period is indicated (in 37 CFR 1.703  or 1.704 ) as "beginning" on a particular day, that day is included in the period, in that such day is "day one" of the period and not "day zero." For example, a period beginning on April 1 and ending on April 10 is ten (and not nine) days in length.  This period of adjustment of patent term is due to examination delay.

Further, 35 U.S.C. 154(b)(2)(C)(iii)  gives the Office the authority to prescribe regulations establishing circumstances that constitute "a failure of an applicant to engage in reasonable efforts to conclude processing or examination of an application." 35 U.S.C. 154(b)(2)(C)  does not require the applicant’s action or inaction (that amounts to a failure to engage in reasonable efforts to conclude prosecution of the application) to have caused or contributed to patent term adjustment for the period of adjustment to be reduced due to such action or inaction.

See 35 U.S.C. 154(b)(3)(C). The "due care" of a reasonably prudent person standard has been applied in deciding petitions under the "unavoidable delay" standard of 35 U.S.C. 133. See In re Mattullath, 38 App. D.C. 497, 514-15 (1912) ("the word ‘unavoidable’ … is applicable to ordinary human affairs, and requires no more or greater care or diligence than is generally used and observed by prudent and careful men in relation to their most important business") (quoting and adopting Ex parte Pratt, 1887 Dec. Comm’r Pat. 31, 32-33); see also Ray v. Lehman, 55 F.3d 606, 609, 34 USPQ2d 1786, 1787 (Fed.

    Section 2750 of the MPEP -  Patent Term Extension for Delays at other Agencies under 35 U.S.C. 156:
		The part of the act codified as 35 U.S.C. 156  was designed to create new incentives for research and development of certain products subject to premarket government approval by a regulatory agency. The statute enables the owners of patents on certain human drugs, food or color additives, medical devices, animal drugs, and veterinary biological products to restore to the terms of those patents some of the time lost while awaiting premarket government approval from a regulatory agency. The rights derived from extension of the patent term under 35 U.S.C. 156(a)  are defined in 35 U.S.C. 156(b), but are not limited to a claim-by-claim basis. Rather, subsection(a) of 156  indicates that "[t]he term of a patent which claims a product, a method of using a product, or a method of manufacturing a product shall be extended." ).

"Drug product" is the active ingredient of a human drug, animal drug (excluding those primarily manufactured using recombinant DNA, recombinant RNA, hybridoma technology, or other processes including site specific genetic manipulation techniques), or biological product (as defined by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act and the Public Health Service Act) including any salt or ester of the active ingredient, as a single entity or in combination with another active ingredient. Animal biological products are approved by the Plant and Animal Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture.

    Section 707.07(f) of the MPEP -  Answer All Material Traversed :
        In order to provide a complete application file history and to enhance the clarity of the prosecution history record, an examiner must provide clear explanations of all actions taken by the examiner during prosecution of an application.
        After an Office action, the reply (in addition to making amendments, etc.) may frequently include arguments and affidavits to the effect that the prior art cited by the examiner does not teach how to obtain or does not inherently yield one or more advantages (new or improved results, functions or effects), which advantages are urged to warrant issue of a patent on the allegedly novel subject matter claimed.

    Section 2106 of the MPEP - 2103 Patent Subject Matter Eligibility:
      There are two criteria for determining subject matter eligibility under 35 U.S.C. 101  and both must be satisfied. The claimed invention (1) must be directed to one of the four statutory categories, and (2) must not be wholly directed to subject matter encompassing a judicially recognized exception, as defined below. THE FOUR CATEGORIES OF STATUTORY SUBJECT MATTER:
        i. Process – an act, or a series of acts or steps.
        ii. Machine – a concrete thing, consisting of parts, or of certain devices and combination of devices.
        iii. Manufacture – an article produced from raw or prepared materials by giving to these materials new forms, qualities, properties, or combinations, whether by hand labor or by machinery.
        iv. Composition of matter – all compositions of two or more substances and all composite articles, whether they be the results of chemical union, or of mechanical mixture, or whether they be gases, fluids, powders or solids, for example

    Section 2800 of the MPEP -  Supplemental Examiniation:
      Supplemental examination provisions of the AIA provide a patent owner with a mechanism to request that the Office consider, reconsider, or correct information believed to be relevant to the patent.
      Unlike ex parte reexamination practice, the information that the patent owner may request to be considered, reconsidered, or corrected in a supplemental examination proceeding is not limited to patents and printed publications. The "information" may include any information that the patent owner believes to be relevant to the patent. For example, the information may include not only a patent or a journal article, but also a sales invoice, or a transcript of an audio or video recording. In addition, the information submitted as part of a request for supplemental examination may involve any ground of patentability, such as, for example, patent eligible subject matter, anticipation, public use or sale, obviousness, written description, enablement, indefiniteness, and double-patenting.
